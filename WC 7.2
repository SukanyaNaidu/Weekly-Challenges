Testcases:

Test case 1: 2/9/2018
Test case 2: 29/12/1989 
Test case 3: 9/8/1765

The output of all the three test cases should be concatenated and displayed as a 
single string. For example, if test case 1 has output ‘X/X/X’ while test case 2
and 3 have ‘V/V/V’ and ‘I/I/I’ respectively then your output string has to be
‘X/X/XV/V/VI/I/I‘
